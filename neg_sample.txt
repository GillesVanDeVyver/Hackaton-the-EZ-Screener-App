Forever on the list of worst-performing companies is Forever 21, 2nd home to the nation’s most fashion-forward customers and, as it turns out, some of its unhappiest staff.
With only 37% of employees willing to recommend the company to a friend, something’s clearly going awry- and if the reviews on Glassdoor are anything to go by, it may have something to do with the inadequate benefits, lack of overtime pay, and unforgiving company policies.
Given the number of lawsuits Forever 21 has been hit with over recent years(including several by former employees, one of which centered on the company’s fondness for detaining staff during their lunch breaks to check they hadn’t nabbed any of the merchandise), you’d think it would be doing everything it could to improve its public image.
Apparently not.
