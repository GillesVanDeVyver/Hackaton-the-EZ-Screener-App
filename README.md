# Problem description

The problem to solve was a case by Bank van Breda to search the web for custumers sentimental values for companies.

Bank van Breda is an investment bank and has a lot of financial knowledge about the companies they are working with.

However, they lack information on the image of the company for the public. 

The task was thus to create a tool to help them to gather this information efficiently.


# Solution

Our solution was to make an application that scraps social business media like indeed.com and Linkedin.

The reviews and comments on a given company are analysed with state of the art deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis.

The results are summarised and presented to the user in a clear GUI.

The application was fully deployed and could run on both pc and mobile.

Our team won the case.
