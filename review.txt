Residential sales and event sales is really fun and rewarding. At first you have to get over rejection, but then you really learn new skills. It is such a good product to sell and exactly what I needed from an entry level sales role. Before I arrived in HelloFresh, I was told it used to be a commission only job with a different structure. The new structure, including the hourly pay and uncapped commissions on top is really good and they do lots of training to develop employees. The training isn't always sales based and they try and develop everyone in lots of different aspects, whilst keeping it casual. Overall if you put the effort in, with the uncapped commissions on top you can earn really good money. </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">HelloFresh employee discount, fun working environment.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Getting out of your comfort zone</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">High per hour salary compared to other production company</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Great place to work, the job is easy but paid enough.

Later in 2021 HelloFresh changed the structure of the sales teams providing a lot more flexibility, autonomy and control for me as an agent. I was offered a great hourly rate and uncapped monthly commissions which has allowed me to build up some personal savings after my years of travelling before the pandemic. I am looking to continue as a sales agent for the next few months and then I would possibly try to apply for another role within HelloFresh since they offer great opportunities to progress in the organisation.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Discounted food, uncapped monthly commissions, great flexibility</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Medewerkers</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Daar praten alles mooi.

Its a task in itself to get gloves, to protect your hands! My first day, they put me on frozen meats and NEVER supplied me with the proper gloves..  worst part is finishing early, several times a week, when work is short. Youre not compensated and have to use your own personal time to make up the difference!!!

However, middle-management had no idea what was going on, things would shut down for an hour for no known reason (and we couldn't warm up or take a seat during that time) and sometimes they just canceled because they didn't have work for me, which is not good for an hourly worker.

<span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Good place to start a career</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">As mentioned above, good atmosphere, pay seems to wane from expectations. I wish I had the ability to stay here longer, yet, I need to be paid for what I deserve.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Very friendly environment and overall great experience </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Yes I recommend working for the company, they have helped me start my career and they have answered any questions I have had and have been such a good company to have worked for. It is not for the lazy though, but I found the job made me learn a lot and I pushed myself to be a better person</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Productive and fun place</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">I have been there for more than 5 years now and it has a great culture. Managers really care about your career growth and there is alot of room to grow. Overall great place to work.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Productive, enjoyable, and family-oriented</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">They provide training and are more than willing to help. The management will have an individual helping to mentor while working.  If you want to explore a different type of project they share work. Encourage you to finish your work and leave at 5 pm to spend time with your family, which provides a good work-life balance.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Lunch and Learns Fair pay Great benefits</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Good work culture. </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">The company seems to genuinely care about employees. 40 hour weeks were the norm, with some extra work around deadlines. I saw a lot of people get opportunities for advancement. </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Family orientated</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">I love everything about this company.

Leadership is one sided only. They are perfect and they look at you like scum everyday. Human resources is not what you think. People here just want their check and leave. There is no team family environment like they say. Management talk badly about other team leaders. Team leaders talk bad about other team leaders. This is a gossip swamp. There is no growth or career development moving forward. If you work here just do not even waste your time with these unprofessional people thinking their do not stink and trust me it does from a mile a way with that attitude and horrible leadership skills. Not even their benefits are good you have to pay high deductibles and it made just it horrible with the pandemic. </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">None</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Lack of leadership, communication and poor attitudes</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Undervalue support staff</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">They do not value their support staff. Bonuses and raises are not the same as their engineers. Engineers here seem to be ok. Have seen more long time employees leave because they did not feel they were respected.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Great if your a workaholic</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">I worked here for 8 months and had to leave due to a personal family decision. During my time here I was often given no direction as far as what needed to be done when. Different styles for different managers which made it difficult to adhere to one company wide format. There were multiple instances where I had to stay late until sunrise due to poor coordination on projects. Had to stay up 4 nights in a row to complete a small project on time due to engineers submitting their revised work just shy of the project deadline. Was never informed ahead of time. Work always had to be done with little or no lead time. Made family life impossible to plan for. Good benefits though, and you will need them because you'll most likely have to buy pharmaceuticals to deal with the stress and weight you will gain from not being able to exercise.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">My experience</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">I have no experience with as a whole, but as far as my experience with San Antonio office is experience is concern, I have a bitter experience. The manager in San Antonio office is the worst person ever I have experienced in my whole professional career, he is the worst.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Steady, nothing more, nothing less</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Dull projects. Lack of enthusiasm around office and low morale- both probably attributed to the uninteresting project workload. Feels like working for the government. </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/> </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/>The pay is good, year end bonus not so much. </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/> </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/>Management is delusional.

Maybe theres a reason no one else wants them...</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Overall company culture is great, but some teams don't follow it</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">As an EIT, most days are spent working with PM's on various projects within different CAD programs. I improved writing skills and skills with various programs but days get monotonous and some PM's are difficult to work with. The workplace culture is good for the most part, and overall the company really cares about its employees. Sometimes that doesn't apply to individual teams though.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">worked there for 13 years and position eleminated</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">it seemed like a good place and fast moving, then one day after 13 years my position was eliminated and with no opportunity to relocate as others were given. they were done with me after  13 years and no explanation other than automation and moving work to headquarters.

Assistants</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Most the time I thought management were not being honest with their employees.  Not much room for advancement for Admins.  No one trusted the HR Department staff who would tell you not to do certain things then turn around and do the very things we were told not to do.  Sometimes business became slow.

Feels like working for the government. </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/> </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/>The pay is good, year end bonus not so much. </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/> </span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/>Management is delusional. They chase projects that no one else wants and consistently lose money on them. Maybe theres a reason no one else wants them...</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Overall company culture is great, but some teams don't follow it</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">As an EIT, most days are spent working with PM's on various projects within different CAD programs. I improved writing skills and skills with various programs but days get monotonous and some PM's are difficult to work with. The workplace culture is good for the most part, and overall the company really cares about its employees. Sometimes that doesn't apply to individual teams though.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">worked there for 13 years and position eleminated</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">it seemed like a good place and fast moving, then one day after 13 years my position was eliminated and with no opportunity to relocate as others were given. they were done with me after  13 years and no explanation other than automation and moving work to headquarters. I had just been part of the transition team for the new system from January to May 2017 for a new system and worked many long hours and weekend in corporate office to be laid off due to elimination of position.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">seemed like i was useful to company for 13 years</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">job was eleimnated and no notice was given after 13 years</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Halff is a whole company.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Great company loved the culture. Busy but fun! Very professional competent smart employees. Career advancement opportunities are based on your level of commitment.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">The Google of safety consulting!!</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Had to move out state.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Great place for young engineers to learn</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">As an intern, was exposed to production team meetings and functions. From this I was able to see what kinds of projects were happening around me. The internship experience was positive enough for me to seek a full-time position at the company.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Great place to work</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Nice Staff</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/>Great Management Team</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/>Non-Stress Work Environment</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/>Optional Training Seminars Every Week</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/>Grows employees with responsibilities</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"><br aria-hidden="true"/>Advancement Opportunities</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Friends make it further than hard workers</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Summary sums it. Accused of things that cannot be rebuted. Part of a group that was "invisible" to the major company. Never socialized, always worked, but yet the office pariah even though I helped profit.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Halff Associates</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Overall a very enjoyable place to work.  Everyone was friendly and patient with me as an intern and I returned their kindness with hard work and quality work.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Great place for engineering degree</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">This is a great place to work if you have an engineering degree.  The managers were really nice, easy to get a long with.  They always had fun events, holiday activities, company outings, etc.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">They did not value Admin. Assistants</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Most the time I thought management were not being honest with their employees.  Not much room for advancement for Admins.  No one trusted the HR Department staff who would tell you not to do certain things then turn around and do the very things we were told not to do.  Sometimes business became slow.  Management let the Engineers get away with anything they wanted to.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Most the time environment was upbeat</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Did not value Admins.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Somewhat relaxed work environment.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0">Large Engineering firm with a Landscape Architecture department. Fun people to work with. Good benefits and team building outside of the office.  Hard to advance once you get to a certain level.</span><span class="css-82l4gy eu4oa1w0"></span>
